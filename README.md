## üöÄ What is LenX?

LenX is a trusted service that verifies X identity and mints LenX Handles to be 1<>1 linked with Lens Accounts. It allows to:

1.  **Simplify Onboarding:** Bring X users into Lens seamlessly, keeping their existing X handle.
2.  **Prevent Fakes:** Validate that a given Lens Account is actually controlled by the same person who has the same X handle.
3.  **Social Discovery:** Discover who of your X friends is already on Lens.

LenX aims to bridge the gap between the Web2 social experience you know and the exciting possibilities of Web3 social.
